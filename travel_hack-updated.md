# Journey Tips


Seven years back, I penned down my [travel insights]. A revisit to that page recently made me realize that much of it has become outdated. For instance, the pandemic has drastically transformed my travel rhythm and frequency. Many of the products I talked about have been phased out. Hence, here's my updated 2022 edition. 


### Apps & Services
* Global Entry Appointments and Renewal: Securing a Global Entry appointment for interview or renewal have proven to be pretty difficult. I used an [appointment scanner / alerter](https://www.ttptracker.com/) and it's totally worth the $29. They even have a free options too. You can easily find one within one day of siging up. Note: It also works for NEXUS, SENTRI, MEXICO-FAST, and CANADA-FAST.

* [TripIt Pro](https://www.tripit.com/pro) Unfortunately in 2022, there isn’t a superior alternative to TripIt. The app appears neglected but there's no better method to consolidate all travel plans in one spot. I continue to use it but have disabled all notifications as I find their travel updates slow and ineffective (more on this below).
* [Flighty](https://www.flightyapp.com/) has completely replaced the gate and schedule notifications from TripIt. It’s a bit pricey but the UI is fantastic, notifications are incredibly fast, and it provides a wealth of additional information, like tracking the aircraft 25 hours prior to departure, on-time stats, and more. The live activities feature is remarkable.

* [Seat Alerts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seat-alerts/id533533342) I’ve always been particular about seats, but even more so since the pandemic. For most aircraft models and airline-specific configurations, I know exactly where I want to sit. If you share this sentiment and miss out on your preferred seats, $0.99 (per flight) on this app will get you alerts for all your favorite seats so you can grab them as soon as they're available.


## Air Travel

The pandemic prompted me to significantly cut back on my travel. I also intend to travel less in the future due to environmental considerations. My objective is to be physically present for a select few important meetings and participate in others remotely. 

Being an older millennial, my philosophy for air travel is to choose the flights with the least number of layovers (irrespective of cost), via major hubs (for back-up options), and solely on airlines where I hold a high status. If a meeting cannot align with my travel preferences, I choose to skip those meetings.


### Luggage

I continue to vouch for my [Minaal carry-on](https://www.minaal.com/products/carry-on-bag-3?variant=35008575864989) for most brief trips. For extended journeys, I supplement it with a small carry-on suitcase. I utilize a range of camera cubes to pack camera equipment into these unless I decide to travel with a sizable camera backpack for photography excursions.

## Jetlag / Sleep

I strive to mitigate jet lag as much as possible. My primary care doctor has aided me in figuring out strategies to curb jetlag.

a) **If you're arriving before noon at your destination (TLDR: Sleep for the majority of the flight duration)**  
- Have a hearty meal at the airport. Try to avoid eating on the flight as much as you can (also for covid reasons I try to keep the mask off time to a minimum).  
- Stay awake for a few hours, then take an Ambien (you’ll need a prescription from your doctor first), and go to sleep. Ensure there are at least 6 more hours on the flight to allow you time to wake up _before_ landing.
- Grab a coffee at your destination, then eat a substantial breakfast.  
- This strategy allows me to stay awake until after 10 pm at my destination and my sleep cycle resets when I go to sleep. On the first night, I sometimes take half an Ambien to ensure a sound sleep through the night.

b) **If landing at the destination late afternoon to evening**:  
There's no strict advice here but avoid sleeping much on the flight. Certainly take a couple of naps but stay awake and watch as many mediocre movies as possible. Evade alcohol and caffeine. Then eat a light dinner at the destination and take an Ambien before going to bed at 10 pm or later. 

**Other relevant gear**:
- [Manta Sleep Mask](https://mantasleep.com/products/manta-sleep-mask). These are compact and very comfortable, replacing my earlier recommendation of an Ostrich Pillow. The large eye cups exert no pressure on your eyes. 
- [Airfly](https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/airfly) allows me to use my own headphones with airplane TV consoles.
- [Travel Humidifier](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Z64CSTJ/?th=1) I always carry a travel humidifier if space permits. I've tried several and this one has proven the most efficient. The dry air on flights and in hotel rooms often makes me feel like I have a cold and having one of these really helps. My sleep quality also improves.

## Technology

### Chargers

- Having mostly transitioned to a USB-C world (except my iPhone which I anticipate will switch with version 15), all my old chargers have been substituted with Anker 6ft braided cables (I carry at least 4), and [Anker Gan bricks](https://www.anker.com/ganprime?ref=naviMenu). 
- For charging on-the-go, I have a small [Anker 622 Magnetic Battery (MagGo)](https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Magnetic-Foldable-Wireless-Interstellar/dp/B09925S3R9) but I usually just top off when I’m near power.

I keep everything in a [Electronic Dopp Kit](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/tech-pouch/?variant=11531003166764) from Peak Design. It also houses a mini router, flat ethernet cable, additional small cables, an extra yubikey, spare sd cards, and adapters to convert USB-A → USB-C (and vice versa). The key tip is to keep this packed and ready at all times and not to use your daily chargers/cables here (the same rule applies to a regular Dopp kit).

#### Air Tags
I have concealed AirTags in all my bags. [Moment AirTag holders](https://www.shopmoment.com/airtags) are excellent for mounting in hard-to-find places. My home is a significant location, so it doesn't alert me when I forget things here, but it will when I travel. 

### SIM cards

Previously, I would pick up sim cards at airports. I don't do that anymore. I maintain my Verizon travel plan to stay connected with family. I also obtain a country-specific [eSim](https://www.airalo.com/) for data, which has now become very convenient. Airalo now has an app to simplify this further.


### Apple Watch Face

- **Travel items**: I have a list of "things to always carry" that I check off before each trip. This includes everyday stuff like my chargers and tech gear, as well as travel-specific items like travel-sized toiletries, masks, and other essentials. It's easier to have this checklist than to scramble last minute to remember everything.

### What’s on my wrist

- I have designed a [travel-focused mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608) that activates when I enter the geofence of Newark Liberty International Airport or launch a travel-related app. This switch alters all the apps on my home screen and modifies my watch face as well.

## Various Recommendations

- **Medical Kit**: I recommend keeping a compact medical kit in your bag. Aside from standard first aid items, I fill mine with portable versions of the [most frequently used medications](https://www.rescue-essentials.com/medications-unit-dose-pack/), including Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Cetirizine, and Diphenhydramine (all in labelled, sealed, individual use packets). After spending countless hours searching for a pharmacy in unfamiliar countries and still not finding the correct medication, I now maintain a small laminated checklist and replenish this kit before every journey.
- **Pandemic Kit**: I also pack at least two rapid tests for each day I'm traveling, and schedule PCR tests before departure and upon return. For ensuring good ventilation in meeting rooms, I use an [Aranet Co2 monitor](https://www.amazon.com/Aranet4-Home-Temperature-Ink-Configuration/dp/B07YY7BH2W). For air travel, I use an [Envo mask (N95)](https://envomask.com/) and for the rest of the time, I use [KN95s](https://shopvida.com/products/high-protection-recyclable-masks#208100000603).
- **Backup Wallet**: I always keep a secondary wallet hidden in my bag, which holds an alternative ID, credit + debit card, and some cash.
- **Pre-marked Map**: Prior to traveling, I ensure that my hotel locations are marked on a Google map of the respective city and saved to a list named after the city. Additionally, I take a few extra minutes to locate the nearest emergency room (only for international trips), pharmacy, and health-oriented grocery store and save them. This turns out to be unexpectedly helpful. When exploring around your hotel or city, and needing to grab some food/drinks/water/snacks, you'll know exactly where to go without having to research places while standing on a street corner. This doesn't have to be an overly comprehensive, spontaneity-killing process.
- **Pack Light**: This is more of a philosophy than a travel hack, but it's one that has served me well over the years. By limiting the number of items you bring on a trip, you'll make the journey more enjoyable and less stressful. It takes a bit of practice and discipline, but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder how you ever managed with so much luggage before!
